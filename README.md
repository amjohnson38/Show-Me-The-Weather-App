# Show-Me-The-Weather-App
Show Me The Weather from Free Code Camp's Zipline Challenge
The purpose of this project was to build a weather app where the user can see the weather at their current location, receive the temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius if they desire, and also include a picture to reflect the weather in the given location. In order you to get the full effect of this project, please make sure that you have used (https instead of http) in the Codepen address link.
